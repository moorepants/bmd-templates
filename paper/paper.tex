\section*{Abstract:}
The abstract must fit on this title page and should not include figures,
tables, or citations. The abstract has the section heading \textbf{Abstract:},
bold 11~pt Times New Roman, and the abstract text should be written in Times
New Roman, 10~pt. The primary paper contents should start on the second page. Replace the example keywords below with suitable keywords of your choice. The keywords must be capitalized and separated by semicolons.

%% Keywords. Call \addKeywords and provide your keywords of choice. Keywords must be capitalized and separated by semicolons.

\section*{Introduction}
Authors are requested to upload a paper of 6 to 12 pages (including references
and figures) to the Orvium web site by the stated date in the call for papers.
Please upload your finished manuscript as \verb|.odt|, \verb|.docx|. or zipped
LaTeX project.  PDFs will not be accepted. For LaTeX documents, upload a single
ZIP file that includes the minimum set of source files needed to build a PDF.
The ZIP file should be named using the following pattern
\verb|Surname1Surname2Surname3_paper.zip|. The primary LaTeX file should be
named \verb|paper.tex| and should reside in the root of the ZIP file directory
tree or under the only top level directory, e.g.  \verb|paper/paper.tex|.
Orvium compatible LaTeX packages are listed in the \verb|bmd2023p.cls| file;
use of other packages may not function with Orvium.

The paper must be written in English. It must contain the names, affiliations,
and e-mail addresses of the authors. Do not edit the list of publisher
variables. The paper size is European A4 (21 x 29.7~cm). The left and right
margins are 1.27~cm, the top margin (not including the header) is 2.5~cm, and
the bottom margin is 1.9~cm. The title should be in Times New Roman 18~pt, and
may extend over more than one line. The author's name or authors' names should
be in Times New Roman 10~pt and the affiliation should be in 8~pt. Section
headings are in Times New Roman 11~pt and the primary text is in Times New
Roman 10~pt. All of these fonts are already set and should not be edited. Only
use \verb|\section| and \verb|\subsection| for sectioning the paper's contents.

\section*{Equations, Figures, and Tables}

Equations should be numbered continuously according to the format shown in
Equation~(\ref{eq:equ1}):
\begin{equation} \label{eq:equ1}
  e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0,
\end{equation}
where the unknown symbols are explained after the equation.

Figures, graphs, and tables must be included using the same style as in
Figure~\ref{fig:fig1} and Table~\ref{tab:tab1}. Both figures and tables should
be centered on the page. Use of at least 300~dpi resolution for images and line
art is required, 1~px wide lines in figures should be avoided as they may
become invisible in print.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=55mm]{figure1}
    \caption{An example of a figure caption. Use 10~pt Times New Roman. Use the
      same style for the tables.}
    \label{fig:fig1}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{table}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \caption{Example of a table with a short caption.} \label{tab:tab1}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|ccc|}
      \hline
      &  $x$  &  $y$  &  $z$ \\
      \hline
      $x'$  &  $\alpha_1$ & $\beta_1$ & $\gamma_1$ \\
      $y'$  &  $\alpha_2$ & $\beta_2$ & $\gamma_2$ \\
      $z'$  &  $\alpha_3$ & $\beta_3$ & $\gamma_3$ \\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

\section*{Bibliography}

Bibliographical citations should be written in alphabetical order in the
\textbf{References} section at the end of the document and use the APA citation
system and the APA format. See the \textbf{References} section below, where
\citep{Pac02} exemplifies the case of a textbook, \citep{Ber07} is an article
in a conference proceedings, and \citep{Sha71} is an article in a journal. Make
use of the \verb|natbib| package with \verb|\citep{}| or \verb|\citet{}| for
citations. If using a \verb|.bib| file, use the \verb|apalike| bibliography
style to get APA formatting.

\section*{Conclusion}

We very much look forward to welcoming you in Delft! Best wishes and the
warmest regards from the Organizing Committee of Bicycle and Motorcycle
Dynamics 2023.
